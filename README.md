# graphql

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/cryptix/go-graphql?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/cryptix/go-graphql)

GraphQL packages for golang.

## Notes

I started this as a fun project when facebook first announced GraphQL and all of this is just based on scraping together stuff from slides.

My commitment to this is still _fun only_ so don't get your hopes up to get a feature complete implementation anytime soon.
