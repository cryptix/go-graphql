# gographql

GraphQL packages for golang.

## Notes

I started this as a fun project when facebook first announced GraphQL and all of this is just based on scraping together stuff from slides.

My commitment to this is still _fun only_ so don't get your hopes up to get a feature complete implementation anytime soon.
